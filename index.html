            <div class="young-me-info">For most of my younger life I always loved spending my time outdoors, whatever that may have been. If it was outdoors I was doing it. I grew up loving sports also, baseball being my favorite sport I played it for 13 years and eventually got burned out so I moved to football which I loved. I also loved playing video games mostly playing the Halo franchise and Call of Duty and Skyrim. </div>

        <div class="adult-me-info">After High school i didnt really know what I wanted to do. I went to Blinn community college for a semester and discovered school really wasnt for me so I took up welding and I absolutely loved it. I welded for my step-dad for 8 years. Doing all sorts of welding and honing my skill. I did pipe welding and structural welding, I learned that pipe welding is my favorite. I moved to Waco for a year and came back to continue welding. After sometime I lost my passion for it, which led me to something I always took an interest in which is coding.</div>
